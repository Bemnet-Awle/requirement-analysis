## 🧩 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where stakeholders, analysts, and developers work together to **gather, understand, analyze, and define what the software system should accomplish**. This stage acts as the foundation upon which all future design, development, and testing activities are built.

### 🔍 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Defines Clear Project Scope**  
  It helps ensure everyone involved has a shared understanding of what the software will do, preventing misunderstandings or scope creep.

- **Drives Design and Development**  
  The functional and non-functional requirements gathered guide the architecture, interface design, and system behavior.

- **Improves Communication**  
  It bridges the gap between technical teams and non-technical stakeholders by translating business needs into clear, actionable items.

- **Enhances Quality and User Satisfaction**  
  Well-analyzed requirements reduce the risk of rework and ensure the final product aligns with user expectations.

### 🧠 What Does the Process Include?

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting needs via interviews, surveys, observation, etc.
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Clarifying and refining stakeholder input.
- **Requirement Documentation**: Recording use cases, user stories, and specifications.
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring accuracy and feasibility through stakeholder feedback.
- **Requirement Prioritization**: Identifying the most critical features to implement first.

### 📌 Types of Requirements

- **Functional Requirements**: Specific features and behaviors (e.g., login, search).
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, usability, and scalability concerns.

> ✅ In summary, **Requirement Analysis lays the groundwork for a successful project** by aligning technical deliverables with business goals. Skipping or rushing this step often leads to costly changes, delays, or system failure later in the project.

> ## 🌟 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical stages in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures the software meets business goals, satisfies user needs, and avoids costly mistakes down the line. Here are three key reasons why it’s essential:

### 1. 🧭 Defines a Clear Project Scope
Requirement Analysis helps all stakeholders align on what the software should and shouldn’t do. This clarity prevents **scope creep**, reduces misunderstandings, and ensures that development stays focused and efficient.

### 2. 🛠️ Guides Design and Development
The requirements serve as the **blueprint for system design and implementation**. Functional requirements dictate features and behaviors, while non-functional requirements shape performance, security, and scalability—helping developers build the right solution the first time.

### 3. ✅ Ensures Quality and User Satisfaction
By accurately identifying and validating stakeholder needs early on, Requirement Analysis reduces rework and helps create a product that truly meets **user expectations**, leading to higher satisfaction and fewer post-release issues.

> In short, Requirement Analysis is not just a planning phase—it’s a success enabler.

## 🛠️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several key activities that help ensure software requirements are accurate, complete, and aligned with stakeholder needs. Below are the five core activities:

- **📥 Requirement Gathering**  
  This is the initial stage where information is collected from stakeholders, users, and other relevant sources through interviews, surveys, questionnaires, observation, and document analysis.

- **🧠 Requirement Elicitation**  
  In this phase, the gathered data is refined and clarified. It involves deeper discussions, brainstorming, prototyping, and workshops to uncover the underlying needs behind the stated requirements.

- **📝 Requirement Documentation**  
  All validated requirements are formally recorded in structured formats such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use case documents. This serves as the official reference for all project stakeholders.

- **📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  The documented requirements are analyzed for feasibility, completeness, consistency, and clarity. Modeling tools like data flow diagrams (DFDs), use case diagrams, or UML are used to visualize and validate system behavior and structure.

- **✅ Requirement Validation**  
  This final step ensures the requirements are correct, complete, and approved by stakeholders. Techniques like reviews, walkthroughs, and prototypes are used to verify that the documented requirements accurately represent user needs.

> These activities form a strong foundation for building successful software systems by reducing ambiguity and aligning expectations early in the SDLC.

## 📑 Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are broadly classified into **Functional** and **Non-functional** requirements. Both are essential to ensure the system performs correctly and meets user expectations.

### 🔧 Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define **what the system should do** — the core features and behaviors of the application.

#### Definition:
These are specific actions or tasks the system must perform. They describe the interactions between the system and its users.

#### Examples (Booking Management Project):
- Users must be able to **register and log in** securely.
- The system should allow users to **search for available properties** based on location and date.
- Users must be able to **book a property** and receive a confirmation email.
- Admins should be able to **add, edit, or remove listings** from the system.
- The system should allow users to **view and manage their bookings**.

### ⚙️ Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define **how the system should behave** — the quality attributes and constraints of the system.

#### Definition:
These requirements describe system performance, usability, reliability, security, and other attributes that impact user experience and system operation.

#### Examples (Booking Management Project):
- The system must load **all pages within 2 seconds** under normal conditions.
- It should support **up to 10,000 concurrent users** without performance degradation.
- All user data must be **encrypted in transit and at rest**.
- The application should have **99.9% uptime availability**.
- The UI must be **mobile-responsive** and accessible on all major browsers.

> Understanding both types of requirements ensures the system is both functional and reliable — meeting user needs while delivering a high-quality experience.

## 🧭 Use Case Diagrams

### What are Use Case Diagrams?

Use Case Diagrams are a type of behavioral diagram defined by UML (Unified Modeling Language) that visually represents how different types of users (actors) interact with the system. Each use case describes a specific functionality provided by the system to the user.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- **Visual Clarity**: Quickly communicate system functionality and user interactions.
- **Requirement Validation**: Help verify that all user interactions and functionalities are covered.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Make it easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand how the system will work.

### Use Case Diagram: Booking Management System

Below is a use case diagram showing the main actors and use cases for our property booking system:

### Key Actors:
- **User**: Searches properties, books listings, manages bookings.
- **Admin**: Manages property listings, views bookings.
- **System**: Sends notifications, handles payments.

### Key Use Cases:
- User Registration & Login  
- Property Search  
- Make a Booking  
- View Booking History  
- Cancel Booking  
- Admin Login  
- Add/Edit/Delete Property Listings  
- View All Bookings  
- Send Confirmation Emails  
- Process Payments

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### Why It Matters
Acceptance Criteria define the conditions a feature must meet to be considered complete. They ensure clarity, guide development and testing, prevent scope creep, and align expectations between stakeholders.

### Example: Checkout Feature (Booking Management System)

**User Story:**  
_As a user, I want to securely check out after selecting a booking so I can confirm my reservation and receive a receipt._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can review booking details before payment.
- Total cost, taxes, and discounts are clearly shown.
- At least two payment methods are available.
- Required fields (name, billing info) are validated.
- Successful payment shows confirmation and sends email.
- Failed payments show clear error and allow retry.
- Checkout completes within 10 seconds under normal load.
